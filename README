This aims to show that variables can be lost with recursive role calls.

To see the problem, run
  ansible-playbook testplaybook.yml
in the root directory or in logging_flattened.
The result should be the same. This shows that the problem is not in 
nesting of subroles (lexical nesting) but in nested role calls with
recursion (dynamic nesting), because the roles in logging_flattened do
not have a nested structure of subroles and still show the problem.

The dynamic call chain is: logging -> rsyslog -> basics -> rsyslog.
The problem is the last step.
